# EBANK

The **EBANK** mobile banking app, built with Flutter, features a simple, user-friendly interface where users can send money effortlessly. Starting from a login page with smooth transitions, users are directed to a dashboard with a **Send Money** form. This form includes fields for the recipient's name, amount, and payment method, with built-in validation to ensure correct inputs, as well as a favorite toggle switch. Custom widgets are used for buttons and text fields to keep the design consistent. After completing a transaction, a success message appears with a subtle fade-in animation, enhancing the user experience. The appâ€™s cohesive styling and structured code ensure a professional and maintainable design.
